### Welcome to my personal minisite! (Last Update: November 2023)

Here is a bit about me. I graduated with my PhD from Drexel University in the Spring of 2023. My advisor was J. Douglas Wright. I am currently an AMCS Postdoc and a part of the [Center for Mathematical Biology](https://mathbio.sas.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania. 
I love learning and problem solving, and I also enjoy collaborating as well as teaching the things I have learned. 
My research as a PhD student involved proving things about waves traveling through lattices made of "random" material. If you want to know a bit more about my research as a PhD student, see 
below, or you can have a look at my [research statement](https://github.com/Joshua-A-McGinnis/Joshua-A-McGinnis/blob/main/ResearchStatement-McGinnis%20(1).pdf). For an even briefer introductory account, go [here](https://dsweb.siam.org/The-Magazine/Article/student-feature-joshua-a-mcginnis).

I find the use of simulations especially helpful in learning, and I am hoping to use this page in the future to upload any numerical work related to my research. 

## Waves in lattices with random material components 

I wrote a [paper](https://www.aimsciences.org/article/doi/10.3934/dcdss.2021100) with my advisor proving the existence of traveling waves in a 1D lattice with random material components.

I followed this up with a [2D lattice](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/sapm.12612) (the analysis was harder in the 2D case). 

Most recently, my PhD advisor and I were able to rigorously prove that FPUT lattices with certain random masses are approximated by a KdV equation. The [paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4601737) is currently under review. 

## Other Endeavors 

I enjoy trying to learn about things I don't know, and I find the best way to do this is to try to solve problems. 

### Parameter Estimation via Machine Learning

I recently (Fall 2022) took a very good class on machine learning because I wanted to potentially use tools from machine learning to estimate properties of lattices by observation of its dynamics. 
This is a rather large question, so I worked on a fairly small example. I wrote a [report](https://github.com/Joshua-A-McGinnis/Joshua-A-McGinnis/blob/main/OtherEndeavors/Basic_Experiment_Estimating_Medium_Parameters%20(1).pdf) for the class which discusses basic methods of parameter estimation for a dynamical system. The course was taught by Drexel Professor, Gordon Richards. It is worth checking out his course [page](https://github.com/gtrichards/PHYS_440_540) in case you are a student considering a similar class at another university. 

### Physical Zero-Knowledge Proof
I wrote a [pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04113) with my friend and fellow PhD student, Eammon, which outlines a protocol in which someone can prove they have a solution to a game of [Flow Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bigduckgames.flow&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1), without revealing or giving away any information about the solution. This protocol can be carried out with a physical deck of cards. Such protocols are known as physical zero-knowledge proofs. 

### Consensus Protocol

When I was an early PhD student, I got a chance to work on a question in the dynamics of reaching a consensus. One mathematical [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeGroot_learning  ) that is widely cited was created by Morris H. DeGroot. 

I believe popularity of the model came from its the simplicity. In DeGrootâ€™s model, certain networks are able to reach consensus while others cannot and this depends on connectivity properties of the network. 
One assumption in the basic DeGroot model is that agents update their beliefs simultaneously, so what happens if we throw out that assumption and instead assume agents choose to update their beliefs in a random order? 
Can the same networks still reach consensus? I found that within the context of the DeGroot model, [they do](https://github.com/Joshua-A-McGinnis/Joshua-A-McGinnis/blob/main/OtherEndeavors/Consensus_Protocol_Model%20(1).pdf).
